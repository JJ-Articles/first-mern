## Goal

**Create a twitter-like web app using the MERN stack and explore basic authentication.**

In this tutorial we'll become familiar with how to build web applications that depend on APIs to provide them with services like user authentication and authorization. We’ll be building a very simple website that will allow a user to register an account, log in and log out securely. The stack we’ll be using is the popular MERN stack, which comprises MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. We’ll be using several other technologies along the way, but those four are the biggies.

## Background

This is a tutorial for beginners, so don’t worry if you don’t have very much familiarity with one or more of the technologies we just mentioned. We’ve created a list of resources that should help.

The most import concepts to grasp are how clients and servers interact by exchanging HTTP messages; the role that React plays as a front-end library; the role that Node and Express play on the back-end to serve our API; and the difference between client-side routing and traditional server-side routing.

## Overview

1. We’ll begin by setting up our React project and ensuring that we’re able to use a development server to serve some React boilerplate to our browser.
2. Next, we’ll set up a very simple Express server and ensure that we can use it to serve a simple page to our browser.
3. Then we’ll install MongoDB, and make sure that we’re able to start it, and interact with it via the Mongo shell.
4. Using Express and MongoDB together is much easier with an ORM, so we’ll install Mongoose. After making some edits to our Express server script, we’ll ensure that our Express server can connect to MongoDB.
5. At this point, we’ll jump back to the front-end and use React Router to set up some client-side routing. We’ll also create a couple of simple React components for our routes to render.
6. Returning to the Express server we’ll create a couple of routes that our front-end will eventually use to fetch data.

## During Development

While building this project, when you come back to this project after being away, remember to take the following steps:

1. `Start the React dev server (served on port 3000)`
2. `Start Mongo, if it isn't already running (default port). If you don't start Mongo before starting the Express server, you'll get an error.`
3. `Start the Express server (served on port 8080)`
4. `Use curl (or Postman) to send a POST request to Express to make sure it's working`
5. `Inspect Mongo with Mongo shell and query a record to make sure it's there`


## GLOSSARY

**JSON** stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON uses key:value pairs in which the key is a string and the value can be any data type. It’s very similar to JavaScript’s syntax for objects.

**JWT** stands for JSON Web Token. JWTs are a way of transmitting authentication and authorization information from and to a server without the server needing to store a session ID.

**ORM** which stands Object Relation Management is a way of bridging the gap between object oriented programming languages and (usually) relational databases.
