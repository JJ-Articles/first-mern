# Step 8 - Creating the User Model

Now that Mongo is properly installed and running, the next thingyouneed to do is install Mongoose.

```
npm i mongoose
```

The next thingyouneed to do is create a schema for a new collection thatyou'llcall "User".  Remember, a collection is similar to a table in a relational database. Strictly speaking, Mongo does not use schemas. However, Mongoose can create a sort of schema for us.

Create a new file in the src directory and call it User.js. Copy and paste this code into the file:

```js
// User.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

//you'lluse Mongoose's Schema class to instantiate a schema instance thatyou'llcall UserSchema. The argument thatyoupass to Schema defines the fields that will appear in each document in the collection. Remember, a document is similar to a record.
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    // The key is the name of the fieldyouwant and the value is an object defining the field's properties.
    email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    password: { type: String, required: true }
});

// Nextyouneed to turntheschema into a model.youdo that with Mongoose's model() method. The model method takes as parameters the name of the model and a schema. If you're wondering, the schema definedthecollection and the model gives us the ability to perform CRUD operations on that collection. We're also exporting this module at the same time.
module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

Now that the User model is defined,youcan import it into server.js.

```js
// Add this to the import section of server.js
const User = require("./User.js");
```

At this point,youshould be able to load the React front-end and use the registration form to register a new user.
