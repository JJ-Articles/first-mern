# Step 2 - Set up the Express server

Now run:

```
 npm i express
```

This will install the Express package. You’ll see some more information printed to your screen.

Next, create a new file at the top level (i.e. as a sibling of package.json, README.md, etc.) called server.js.

Open server.js and paste in the following stripped down Express server script:

```js
// server.js

// Use Node's require method to import the Express package
const express = require("express");

// Instantiate an instance of Express
const app = express();

// Create a route that handles a request for the homepage. The callback is our handler. We pass in the HTTP request and response objects and use Express's send() method to send a line of text back to the browser.
app.get("/", function (req, res) {
	res.send("Welcome to the homepage.");
});

// Tell Express to listen to port 8080
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
```

Next, open package.json and at the object's top level, the same level as things like “name” and “,” insert the line

```js
"proxy": "http://localhost:8080"
```

It's important that you don't accidentally insert that line within an object, e.g. don't accidentally insert it in "dependencies" or "scripts".

You’re almost ready to start the Express server, but first you need to install Nodemon. Nodemon is a package that will update your Express server when you make changes to any files. Using Nodemon, you won’t have to manually stop and restart the server every time you make a change.

```
 npm i nodemon
```

Now open package.json again and insert a new script in the scripts object:

```js
"server": "nodemon server.js --inspect --unhandled-rejections=strict"
```

You can now start the Express server with:

```
 npm run server
```

Open your browser and navigate to localhost:8080. The page should load, and you should see the “Welcome to the homepage” message.

NOTE: Installing Nodemon was necessary to avoid stopping and restarting our Express server every time we make a change, but you should note that this extra step was not necessary for our React server. This feature is built into Create React App applications by default.
