# Step 7 - Requesting data from our Express server

Remember that the ultimate goal is to create a site where users can create a new account and log in and out. What we’ve done so far is to create a front-end and a back-end. We’ve connected our back-end to a database. However, our front-end still doesn’t talk to our back-end. Nor have we attempted to create, read, update, or delete any records in our database. Eventually we want our front-end to be able to request that the back-end create and retrieve records to/from our database and send them back to the front-end.
