# Step 7 - Requesting data from our Express server

Remember that the ultimate goal is to create a site where users can create a new account and log in and out. What we’ve done so far is to (1) build a React front-end with some custom routing and a couple of simple components, (2) build an Express server that will serve an API with which our React front-end will communicate, and (3) connect our Express server to a database. But we have a long way to go. Our front-end doesn’t yet talk to that Express server. Nor have we attempted to create, read, update, or delete any records in our database. Eventually we want our front-end to be able to request, via our API, that the Express server create and retrieve records to/from our database and send information back to the front-end.
