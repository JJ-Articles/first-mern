# Step 7 - Requesting data fromtheExpress server

Remember that the ultimate goal is to create a site where users can create a new account and log in and out. What we’ve done so far is to (1) build a React front-end with some custom routing and a couple of simple components, (2) build an Express server that will serve an API with whichtheReact front-end will communicate, and (3) connecttheExpress server to a database. Butyouhave a long way to go.thefront-end doesn’t yet talk to that Express server. Nor haveyouattempted to create, read, update, or delete any records inthedatabase. Eventuallyyouwantthefront-end to be able to request, viatheAPI, that the Express server create and retrieve records fromthedatabase and send information back to the front-end.

Next we're going to install a ORM called Mongoose. Mongoose will help us talk to the Mongo database. Using Mongooseyouan quickly accomplish what would otherwise be much more verbose, tedious, and repetitive tasks.

```
npm i mongoose
```
