# Step 6 - Adding API Routes to the Express Server

The Home and Secret components that we created on the front-end will eventually fetch some data from our Express server. Before that can happen, we need to create the routes that those components will use when fetching that data. Open server.js and replace the current text with the text below. you've removed the comments from previous steps and marked the new code block.

```js
// server.js

const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const app = express();

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
	res.send("Welcome to the homepage.");
});

// START OF NEW STUFF

// Route to homepage info
app.get("/api/home", function (req, res) {
	res.send("Welcome!");
});

// Route to login info
app.get("/api/secret", function (req, res) {
	res.send("The password is potato");
});

// END OF NEW STUFF

const mongo_uri = "mongodb://localhost/first-mern";
mongoose.connect(
	mongo_uri,
	{ useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true },
	function (err) {
		if (err) {
			throw err;
		} else {
			console.log(`Successfully connected to ${mongo_uri}`);
		}
	}
);

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
```

Note that both of these routes start with “/api/”. Also note that the callback function is sending some text back to the browser.

You can test these two new routes by going to localhost:8080/api/home and localhost:8080/api/secret.
