# Step 6 - Adding more routes to our Express server

The Home and Secret components that we created on the front-end will eventually fetch some data from our Express server. That means that we need to return to server.js and add two more routes just below the one route we’ve already defined. Note that both of these routes start with “/api/”. Also note that the callback function is sending some text back to the browser.

```
// Route to homepage info
app.get('/api/home', function (req, res) {
   res.send('Welcome!');
});

// Route to secret info
app.get('/api/secret', function (req, res) {
   res.send('The password is potato');
});
```

You can test these two new routes by going to localhost:8080/api/home and localhost:8080/api/secret.
