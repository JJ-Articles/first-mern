# Step 3 - Install MongoDB

So far, we’ve created a boilerplate React project and confirmed that it can successfully serve our React front-end on port 3000. We’ve also installed the Express package and created a very simple server script to confirm that Express is serving our welcome message on port 8080.

Here’s a quick overview of what we need to do next. We need to install a database that we’ll use to store our users’ account information, i.e. their email address and password. When a user submits the create-an-account form or the login form from their browser, the browser will send an HTTP POST request to our Express server. Express uses another piece of software called an ORM to talk to our database. If the user is creating a new account, our ORM will tell our database to save that new information to a new record. If the user is just logging in, our ORM will query the database to make sure that a matching email and password combination exist.

The database we’re using MongoDB. The ORM that will talk to MongoDB is called Mongoose.

First, check to see if MongoDB is installed on your system. This is complicated by the fact that Windows, Mac, and different versions of Linux do things differently.

NOTE: “mongod” is the name of the MongoDB server application. “mongo” is the name of the MongoDB shell application. The mongo shell can be used to tell mongod to do things from the command line.

On Mac and Linux, if mongod is properly installed and the path is set, then you should be able to run -

```
 mongod --version
```

This will tell you what version of mongod is running.

On Windows you need to search for mongod.exe, which is usually in C:\Program Files\*\*MongoDB\*\*\.

Next, if you have an older version of MongoDB, it might be a good idea to upgrade to 4.4.0. Use this command on Mac and Linux.

Blah blah blah

To check if mongo daemon running on wayland distro: `sudo systemctl status mongod`

To run mongo daemon on wayland distro: `sudo systemctl start mongod`

```
Start mongo CLI:

```

-   `starting CLI session`
    -   `$ mongo`
-   `show all available local databases`
    -   `$ show dbs `
-   `switch to our database`
    -   `$ use react-auth `
-   `see all collections/groups in our current database`
    -   `$ show collections`
-   `Find specific user entries in our database`
    -   `$ db.users.find( {} ) `
    -   `{} is an empty argument that should return all entries within users object`

This is long overdue, but Last Week I Learned (LWIL): (See my new thread for a full list of items.)

-   On Linux, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database software requires a [manual install on Fedora distros](https://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-get-mongodb-server-on-fedora/), even though it was previously included. Be prepared to create a repository file in \*\*<code>/etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb.repo. </code>Yum.repos.d</strong> is one of the default directories used by the Fedora’s system package manager (<strong>dnf</strong> and <strong>yum</strong>) to find source code and install it for us. We also need to also manually set up a directory in the root of the system called <strong>/Data/db</strong> directory that Mongo uses as a convention to store all databases we create locally. This extra work upfront guarantees ease of use later when we want to install and update our MongoDB packages when running sudo dnf install mongo. Unfortunately, this requires use to run Mongo with superuser privileges, and I haven’t gotten around to fixing this yet, although it’s likely we can simply change the permissions of the <strong>/Data</strong> directory to be assigned to our user, and that would be sufficient.
-   After our session, I looked into why MongoDB wasn’t included in Fedora and required as much work as it did to install. One of the strengths of Fedora is how many dev tools and products are pre-installed on their OS or easily available with their DNF package manager. On principle, Fedora only pre-installs software that they consider a [valid open source license](https://opensource.org/osd)--more or less the same approved by the [Freedom Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) or they consider compatible with their GPLv3/AGPLv3 licenses. MongoDB switched to their own license based on the GPLv3 called The Server Side Public License (SSPL) (FAQ linked [here](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq)), in an attempt to stop companies like Amazon from using their products as [Software as a Service](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3226386/what-is-saas-software-as-a-service-defined.html) (SaaS) for free. This is in line with licensing changes by [Redis](https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-labs-modules-license-changes/) and other companies. [The Fedora Project determined MongoDB’s license had enough issues to remove it from their supported repositories](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/legal@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/IQIOBOGWJ247JGKX2WD6N27TZNZZNM6C/).
-   MongoDB itself is centralized: any DB started with Mongo on my machine will be accessible or switch-able through the console, once the Mongo daemon is running and I type in “<strong>mongo</strong>” to the command line to start it’s interactive terminal (written in JavaScript, conveniently).
-   Once logged into the interactive console, we can use the “show-db” command to list all available databases Mongo can see on our local machine. We can then switch to our desired database using the “<strong>use &lt;databaseNameHere></strong>” command and argument.
-   To effectively use a [MERN](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-mern-stack) stack we must at least have three servers running:
    -   The Mongo daemon,
    -   the Express.js backend server/application (Node),
    -   and our React.js frontend application.
-   [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) is an Object Relational Mapper that lets us design our schema and enter data programmatically through our frontend and backend code, rather than needing to manipulate MongoDB, directly. I liked how straightforward and simple their approach was, using simple functions to do most of the heavy lifting for the request and response cycle.
