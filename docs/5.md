# Step 5 - Adding routes to React

The next thing you need to do is to add a couple of routes to the React front-end. Don’t worry if you don’t know much about client-side routing. We’re not going to dwell on it.

First, you'll install React Router, a popular routing library for React.

```
 npm i react-router-dom
```

Now, open src/App.js.

Delete everything in App.js and copy and paste in the following code.

```js
// App.js

import React from 'react';

// Import the methods that we need from 'react-router-dom'
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link} from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
   return (
    <Router>
        <div className="App">
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/login">Log In</Link>
            <Switch>
                <Route exact path="/">
                    <Home />
                </Route>
                <Route exact path="/login">
                    <LogIn />
                </Route>
            </Switch>
        </div>
    </Router>
   );
}

function Home() {
   return <h2>You're on the Homepage!</h2>;
}

function LogIn() {
   return <h2>You're on the LogIn Page!</h2>;
}

export default App;
```

So, we’ve added routing to a Home page and a Log In page. The components that will render when a user visits those pages are the Home and LogIn components respectively. Those components are defined just below App. Now we need to double check that the front-end of our app is still functioning. Refresh your browser and use the new nav links to visit the Home page and the Log In page. The URL in the address bar and text on the page should change.
