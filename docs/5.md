# Step 5 - Adding routes to React

Next, we need to add a couple of routes to our React code. Don’t worry if you don’t know much about React or front-end routing. We’re not going to dwell on React. We need just enough code at this point to navigate to a couple of different pages.

First, we’ll install the browser version of a popular routing library called React Router.

```
 npm i react-router-dom
```

Now, open src/App.js.

One of the first things you may notice is that React uses JavaScript’s native module API. That means that modules are imported like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
```

And exported like this:

```js
export default App;
```

We’re making a note of it here, because we were just looking at a different way to import and export modules in Node.js that used Node’s require() method.

Delete everything in App.js and copy and paste in the following code.

```js
// App.js

import React from 'react';

// Import the methods that we need from 'react-router-dom'
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link} from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
   return (
    <Router>
        <div className="App">
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/secret">Secret</Link>
            <Switch>
                <Route exact path="/">
                    <Home />
                </Route>
                <Route exact path="/secret">
                    <Secret />
                </Route>
            </Switch>
        </div>
    </Router>
   );
}

function Home() {
   return <h2>You're on the Homepage!</h2>;
}

function Secret() {
   return <h2>You're on the Secret Page!</h2>;
}

export default App;
```

Note that we’ve added routing to a Home and Secret component, which we defined below App, we can double check that the front-end of our app is still functioning.
