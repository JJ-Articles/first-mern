# Step 5 - Adding routes to React

Next, we're going to jump back into our React front-end to add a couple of routes to App.js. Don’t worry if you don’t know much about React or client-side routing. We’re not going to dwell on React. We need just enough code at this point to navigate to a couple of different pages.

First, we’ll install the browser version of a popular routing library called React Router.

```
 npm i react-router-dom
```

Now, open src/App.js.

One of the first things you may notice is that React uses JavaScript’s native module API. That means that modules are imported like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
```

And exported like this:

```js
export default App;
```

We’re making a note of it here, because we were just looking at a different way to import and export modules in Node.js that used Node’s require() method.

Delete everything in App.js and copy and paste in the following code.

```js
// App.js

import React from 'react';

// Import the methods that we need from 'react-router-dom'
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route, Link} from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
   return (
    <Router>
        <div className="App">
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/login">Log In</Link>
            <Switch>
                <Route exact path="/">
                    <Home />
                </Route>
                <Route exact path="/login">
                    <LogIn />
                </Route>
            </Switch>
        </div>
    </Router>
   );
}

function Home() {
   return <h2>You're on the Homepage!</h2>;
}

function LogIn() {
   return <h2>You're on the LogIn Page!</h2>;
}

export default App;
```

So, we’ve added routing to a Home page and a Log In page. The components that will render when a user visits those pages are the Home and LogIn components respectively. Those components are defined just below App. Now we need to double check that the front-end of our app is still functioning. Refresh the page on which localhost:3000 is loaded and use the new nav links to visit the Home page and the Log In page. The URL and text on the page should change.
