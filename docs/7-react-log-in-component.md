# Step 7 - React Log In Component

Remember that your ultimate goal is to create a site on which users can create a new account and log in and out. What youâ€™ve done so far is to (1) build a React front-end with some routing and a couple of simple components, (2) build an Express server with a couple of routes that will serve an API with which the React front-end will eventually communicate.

**NOTE - I need to do some work distinguishing the two parts of the tutorial.**

The Log In component you wrote in step 3 renders a line of text to the page whenever a user navigates to the _/log-in_ route. That isn't very useful. What you want the Log In component to do is render a form into which a user can type their username and password. When the user hits submit, the form should call a submit handler that will send an HTTP POST request to the API.

Accomplishing this will require work on both the React application and the API. On the front-end, you need to rewrite your Log In component to render the log in form. You also need to write the submit handler that will send the HTTP POST request to the API. On the back-end, you need to write route handlers that will receive and process the request.

In this step, you'll re-write the Log In component to render the log in form. In the next step, you'll write the submit handler that will send the form data to the API.

Create a new file and name it LogIn.js. Paste in the code below.

```jsx
// LogIn.js

import React, {useState} from 'react';

function LogIn(props) {

        // Use the useState hook to create a state object with email and password properties.
        const [state , setState] = useState( {email : "", password : ""} );

        // Track any change to either input element's value in local state
        const handleChange = (e) => {
            // Deconstruct the id and value properties from the event object's target object
            const {id , value} = e.target;
            // setState can take a callback that updates state. The "id" will be either "email" or "password." The new value will be whatever key was struck.
            setState( prevState => ( {...prevState, [id] : value} ) );
        }

        // Handle form submission
        const handleSubmit = (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            // This is the next order of business
        }

    return(
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <label htmlFor="email">Email address</label>
            <input
                type="email"
                id="email"
                placeholder="Enter email"
                {/* Determine the input's value using state */}
                value={state.email}
                {/* Track any change to the input's value in state  */}
                onChange={handleChange}
            />

            <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
            <input
                type="password"
                id="password"
                placeholder="Password"
                value={state.email}
                onChange={handleChange}
            />

            <button type="submit" >Log In</button>
        </form>
    )
}
```
