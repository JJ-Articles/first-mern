# Step 7 - React Routing Part 2 - Requesting Data from the API

Remember that your ultimate goal is to create a site where users can create a new account and log in and out. What youâ€™ve done so far is to (1) build a React front-end with some routing and a couple of simple components, (2) build an Express server with a couple of routes that will serve an API with which the React front-end will eventually communicate.

The Log In component you wrote in step 3 renders a line of text on the page whenever a user navigates to the /log-in route. That isn't very useful. What you want it to do is render a form into which a user can type their username and password. When the user hits submit, the form should call a submit handler that will send an HTTP POST request containing the form data to the API. Solving this problem will require work on both the front-end/client-side and back-end/server-side. On the front-end, you need to rewrite your Log In component to render the log in form. You also need to write the submit handler that will send the HTTP POST request to the API. On the back-end, you need to write route handlers that will receive and process the request. 

In this step, you'll re-write the Log In component to render the log in form. In the next step, you'll write the submit handler that will send the form data to the API.

Create a new file and name it LogIn.js. Paste in the code below.

```js
// LogIn.js

import React, {useState} from 'react';

function LogIn(props) {

        // Use the useState hook to create a state object with email and password properties.
        const [state , setState] = useState( {email : "", password : ""} );
        
        // Track any change to an input element's value in state
        const handleChange = (e) => {
            // Deconstruct the id and value properties from the event object's target object
            const {id , value} = e.target; 
            // setState can take a callback. The callback updates the state object to the changed input's id (either email or password) and its new value (whatever just occurred to change the input's value).
            setState( prevState => ( {...prevState, [id] : value} ) );
        }

        // Handle form submission
        const handleSubmit = (e) => {
            e.preventDefault();
            // Call sendFormDetailsToAPI
            sendFormDetailsToAPI();
        }

        const sendFormDetailsToAPI = () => {
            // You'll do this in the next step
        }

    return(
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <label htmlFor="email">Email address</label>
            <input 
                type="email" 
                id="email" 
                placeholder="Enter email" 
                {/* Determine the input's value using state */}
                value={state.email} 
                {/* Track any change to the input's value in state  */}
                onChange={handleChange}
            />
               
            <label htmlFor="exampleInputPassword1">Password</label>
            <input 
                type="password" 
                id="password" 
                placeholder="Password" 
                value={state.email} 
                onChange={handleChange}
            />
  
            <button type="submit" >Log In</button>
        </form>
    )
}
```









 
Next we're going to install a ORM called Mongoose. Mongoose will help us talk to the Mongo database. Using Mongoose you can quickly accomplish what would otherwise be much more verbose, tedious, and repetitive tasks.

```
npm i mongoose
```
